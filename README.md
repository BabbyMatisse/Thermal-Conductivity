The proposed methodology take advantage from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to extract essential structural parameters and elastic constants which represent the inputs for revised versions of Slack and Klemens equations. The structural parameters and elastic constants can be also obtained from free on line database like the Materials Project (https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/).
Slack equation is modified by the introduction of a corrective factor, while in the revised Klemens equation a geometric factor d accounting for the impact of point defects on lattice symmetry is added, which is a critical factor in determining thermal conductivity in optical materials with mixed compositions.
